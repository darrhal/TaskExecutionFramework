I need to create a simple Python script that reads a CSV file and prints a summary of the data.
The script should count the number of rows and columns, and show the first 5 rows.
It should handle cases where the CSV file doesn't exist and show a helpful error message.
The script should be named data_summary.py and should be easy to use from the command line.
Please make sure it works with Python 3 and uses only standard library modules.
