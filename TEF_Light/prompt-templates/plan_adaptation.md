## Pathfinder Instructions

Using the four Adapt phase evaluators, perform a complete stateless re-evaluation:

1. **Intent Alignment**: How well does the current working plan align with the original user intent?
2. **Plan Coherence**: Do all tasks in the tree maintain consistency as a whole?
3. **Next Step**: What immediate actions are needed to move forward?
4. **Task Refinement**: Which upcoming tasks need more detail or clarification?

Apply multiple strategist perspectives (Technical, Requirements, Risk, Efficiency) to synthesize your decision.

Perform intent-reality reconciliation: ensure any plan changes maintain alignment with original user goals while adapting to execution discoveries.

Return the updated task structure or indicate no changes are needed.
