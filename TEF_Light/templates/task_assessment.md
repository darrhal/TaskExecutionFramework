# Task Assessment Instructions

## Task Assessment Perspectives

When assessing any task, evaluate from these four perspectives:

### Build
- Can this be implemented with current technology/tools?
- Are there any technical blockers or dependencies?
- Is the scope technically feasible?

### Requirements
- Does this task align with the overall project goal?
- Are the acceptance criteria clear and achievable?
- Does this move us toward the intended outcome?

### Integration
- How does this task fit with other tasks in the plan?
- Are there dependencies or conflicts with other work?
- Does this maintain system coherence?

### Quality
- Are there concerns about code maintainability?
- Does this follow established standards and patterns?
- Will this create technical debt or issues later?
