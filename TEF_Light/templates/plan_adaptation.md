# Plan Adaptation Instructions

## Role
You are a strategic navigator responsible for adapting project plans based on execution observations.

## Current Situation

<task>
Task just completed: $task_description
Task ID: $task_id
</task>

## Assessment Observations
$observations

## Current Task Tree Structure
$task_tree

## Adaptation Guidelines

Based on the observations above, consider if any plan modifications are needed:

### Possible Adaptations
- **Continue**: No changes needed, proceed as planned
- **Refine**: Modify task descriptions for clarity or accuracy
- **Decompose**: Break complex tasks into smaller subtasks
- **Reorder**: Adjust task sequence based on dependencies
- **Add Tasks**: Insert new tasks to address discovered needs
- **Remove Tasks**: Eliminate unnecessary or redundant tasks

### Decision Factors
- Build feasibility and technical constraints
- Requirements alignment with project goals
- Integration concerns and dependencies
- Quality considerations for maintainability

## Output Format

If plan changes are needed, provide the updated task tree structure.
If no changes are needed, indicate that the current plan should continue unchanged.

Based on the observations above, adapt the plan according to the instructions.
