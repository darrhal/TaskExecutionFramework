The task intentionally has some ambiguity to test refinement and decomposition capabilities.\n\n## Objective\nCreate a simple utility that processes data files, but with deliberately vague requirements to test the navigator's ability to refine specifications and decompose complex tasks.\n\n## Initial Requirements\n- Process some kind of data files\n- Do something useful with the data\n- Handle errors appropriately\n- Provide some kind of output\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Files are processed successfully\n- [ ] Error handling is implemented\n- [ ] Output is generated\n- [ ] Code is well-structured\n\n## Notes\nThis task is intentionally underspecified to test:\n1. Navigator's refinement decisions when requirements are unclear\n2. Decomposition when task complexity is detected\n3. Progressive elaboration adding detail as task approaches execution\n4. Multi-strategist perspective gathering\n5. Plan modification based on assessment results",
