# TEF Light Reconciliation Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes inconsistencies between the original Task Execution Framework specification (`Specs/FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md`), the TEF Light specification (`TEF_Light/Specs/FRAMEWORK_LIGHT_OVERVIEW.md`), and the actual implementation in the `TEF_Light/` directory. While the implementation captures the essential Act→Assess→Adapt philosophy and demonstrates solid architectural foundations, several gaps exist in execution mechanics, state management, and extensibility.

## 1. Terminology Inconsistencies

### Navigator vs Pathfinder vs PlanAdapter

**Issue**: Inconsistent naming across specifications and implementation
- **Original spec**: Uses "Navigator" and "Pathfinder" somewhat interchangeably, but favors "Pathfinder" as the "plan search engine"
- **Lite spec**: Consistently refers to "Navigator" 
- **Implementation**: Named `PlanAdapter`

**Impact**: Conceptual confusion and documentation misalignment

**Recommendation**: Standardize on "Navigator" throughout all documentation and code. It better captures the metaphor of navigating through solution space without the gold rush connotations of "Pathfinder."

### Observer vs Assessor Terminology

**Issue**: Conceptual relationship unclear
- **Specifications**: Emphasize "Observers" as information-gathering modules
- **Implementation**: Uses `TaskAssessor` agent

**Status**: Actually correct - the `TaskAssessor` implements the observer pattern by gathering observations from four perspectives

**Recommendation**: Clarify in documentation that the TaskAssessor implements the observer pattern described in specifications.

## 2. Missing Core Components

### 2.1 Controller/Orchestrator Abstraction

**Original Spec Requirement**:
```
### 1. Controller (controller.py)
- Manages the Act→Assess→Adapt loop
- Coordinates all three phases mechanically  
- Handles budgets and depth limits
- Manages dual git commits: after Act and after Adapt
```

**Current State**: Logic exists in `tef_light.py` but lacks formal Controller abstraction

**Impact**: 
- Harder to manage budgets, depth limits, and parallel execution
- Mixed responsibilities in main orchestration file
- No clear separation of concerns

**Priority**: High - needed for execution policy management

### 2.2 Observer Plugin Architecture

**Original Spec Requirement**:
```
observers/
  build_observer.py
  requirements_observer.py
  integration_observer.py
  quality_observer.py
```

**Current State**: Four perspectives hardcoded into `TaskAssessor` system prompt

**Impact**: 
- Cannot add custom observers without modifying core code
- Less extensible for domain-specific assessment needs
- Violates open/closed principle

**Priority**: Medium - affects extensibility but current approach works

### 2.3 Strategist Functions Within Navigator

**Original Spec Requirement**:
```
The Navigator employs multiple strategist functions:
- Technical Strategist: Evaluates decomposition approaches
- Requirements Strategist: Ensures alignment with user intent
- Risk Strategist: Identifies obstacles and failure modes  
- Efficiency Strategist: Seeks simpler solutions
```

**Current State**: Strategists mentioned in PlanAdapter system prompt but not implemented as separate functions

**Impact**: 
- Less robust decision-making synthesis
- Single point of failure in adaptation logic
- Harder to debug/trace adaptation reasoning

**Priority**: Medium - current approach functional but less sophisticated

## 3. Implementation Gaps

### 3.1 Progressive Elaboration

**Spec Requirement**: Tasks evolve from sketches to complete specifications as they approach execution

**Current State**: Accepts only fully-formed TaskNodes from JSON

**Missing Components**:
- Natural language parsing for initial task descriptions
- Specification validation and completeness checking
- Refinement lifecycle management
- "Attention proximity" - detailed refinement for upcoming tasks

**Impact**: Cannot start with simple descriptions and refine them

**Priority**: Medium - limits usability for rapid prototyping

### 3.2 Dual-Purpose Commit Strategy

**Spec Requirement**: 
```
- After every Act: Ensures complete record of environment changes
- After every Adapt: Tracks all plan modifications and refinements
```

**Current State**: Only commits after Act and task completion

**Impact**: Loss of plan evolution traceability - cannot see how the plan itself evolved

**Priority**: High - critical for debugging and understanding plan changes

### 3.3 Failure Threshold Mechanics

**Model State**: TaskNode includes `failure_threshold: float` (0.0-1.0)

**Missing Implementation**:
- Threshold incrementation after failures
- Parent task escalation at threshold 1.0
- Reset mechanism with new approach

**Impact**: Retry logic incomplete, no adaptive failure handling

**Priority**: High - core to the failure handling philosophy

### 3.4 Task Tree Update Logic

**Current Implementation**: `_update_task_tree()` is overly simplistic
```python
def _update_task_tree(original: TaskNode, updated: TaskNode) -> None:
    # For now, just update the root properties
    original.id = updated.id
    original.description = updated.description
    # ... simple property copying
```

**Missing**: 
- Proper tree merging
- Child node updates and additions
- Conflict resolution

**Impact**: Plan adaptations may not propagate correctly through the tree

**Priority**: High - affects core adaptation functionality

## 4. Architectural Deviations

### 4.1 Single Entry Point Consistency

**Spec Requirement**: `ExecuteTask(spec, environment)` as universal entry point

**Current State**: 
- `execute_task(task_tree: TaskNode, environment_path: str)`
- `execute_project_plan(environment_path: str, task_plan_path: str)`

**Impact**: Inconsistent handling between project and task levels

**Recommendation**: Unify under single `execute_task()` that handles both cases

### 4.2 State Management and Artifacts

**Missing Components**:
```
runs/<run-id>/
  attempt-001/
    act/execution.json
    assess/build_observer.json  
    adapt/pathfinder_decision.json
```

**Impact**: 
- No debugging artifacts
- No execution history
- No audit trail

**Priority**: Medium - affects debugging but not core functionality

### 4.3 Configuration System

**Missing**: 
- `observers.yml` for retry limits and policies
- Per-task overrides capability
- Runtime flags for manual control

**Impact**: Hard-coded policies, less flexible deployment

**Priority**: Low - can be addressed later

## 5. What's Working Well ✅

### Excellent Agent Architecture
- Clean separation with `BaseClaudeAgent`
- Individual system prompts per agent type
- Shared Claude SDK functionality

### Proper Structured Outputs
- Pydantic models with full type safety
- JSON schema validation via Claude's tool-use
- No `# type: ignore` suppressions needed

### Template System Implementation
- Follows Anthropic's recommended patterns
- XML tags for complex variables
- Clean separation from agent logic

### Multi-Perspective Assessment
- Four perspectives properly defined
- Structured output for each perspective
- Good separation of observation from decision

### Act Phase Distinction
- Correctly limits Act to atomic tasks only
- Parent tasks orchestrate without direct execution
- Both types participate in assessment

## 6. Near-Term Priorities (Next 1-2 Development Cycles)

## 10. Conclusion

The TEF Light implementation demonstrates strong architectural foundations and correctly implements the core Act→Assess→Adapt philosophy. The agent architecture is particularly well-designed, following Anthropic's best practices for structured outputs and clean separation of concerns.

The primary gaps are in execution mechanics rather than conceptual understanding. The failure threshold system, tree update logic, and plan evolution tracking need implementation to achieve feature parity with the specifications. These are well-defined problems with clear solutions.

The codebase is well-positioned for the identified improvements. The clean architecture makes it straightforward to add the missing components without major refactoring. Focus on the near-term priorities to achieve a fully functional framework that matches the specification's vision.
