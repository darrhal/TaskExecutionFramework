# TEF Light Reconciliation Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes inconsistencies between the original Task Execution Framework specification (`Specs/FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md`), the TEF Light specification (`TEF_Light/Specs/FRAMEWORK_LIGHT_OVERVIEW.md`), and the actual implementation in the `TEF_Light/` directory. While the implementation captures the essential Act‚ÜíAssess‚ÜíAdapt philosophy and demonstrates solid architectural foundations, several gaps exist in execution mechanics, state management, and extensibility.

## 1. Terminology Inconsistencies

### Navigator vs Pathfinder vs PlanAdapter ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Issue**: Inconsistent naming across specifications and implementation
- **Original spec**: Uses "Navigator" and "Pathfinder" somewhat interchangeably, but favors "Pathfinder" as the "plan search engine"
- **Lite spec**: Consistently refers to "Navigator" 
- **Implementation**: Named `PlanAdapter`

**Resolution**: User feedback confirmed standardizing on "**Pathfinder**" terminology. Updated implementation to use Pathfinder class name and find_path() method, emphasizing the agent's role in searching optimal paths through solution space. Note: Pathfinder is the core component of the **Adapt** phase.

### Observer vs Assessor Terminology ‚úÖ **CLARIFIED**

**Issue**: Conceptual relationship unclear
- **Specifications**: Emphasize "Observers" as information-gathering modules
- **Implementation**: Uses `TaskAssessor` agent

**Resolution**: Added documentation to TaskAssessor clarifying that it implements the Observer pattern described in specifications. The TaskAssessor gathers observations from four perspectives (Build, Requirements, Integration, Quality) without making decisions - that's the Pathfinder's job.

## 2. Missing Core Components

### 2.1 Controller/Orchestrator Abstraction

**Original Spec Requirement**:
```
### 1. Controller (controller.py)
- Manages the Act‚ÜíAssess‚ÜíAdapt loop
- Coordinates all three phases mechanically  
- Handles budgets and depth limits
- Manages dual git commits: after Act and after Adapt
```

**Current State**: Logic exists in `tef_light.py` but lacks formal Controller abstraction

**Impact**: 
- Harder to manage budgets, depth limits, and parallel execution
- Mixed responsibilities in main orchestration file
- No clear separation of concerns

**Priority**: High - needed for execution policy management

### 2.2 Observer Plugin Architecture

**Original Spec Requirement**:
```
observers/
  build_observer.py
  requirements_observer.py
  integration_observer.py
  quality_observer.py
```

**Current State**: Four perspectives hardcoded into `TaskAssessor` system prompt

**Impact**: 
- Cannot add custom observers without modifying core code
- Less extensible for domain-specific assessment needs
- Violates open/closed principle

**Priority**: Medium - affects extensibility but current approach works

### 2.3 Strategist Functions Within Navigator

**Original Spec Requirement**:
```
The Navigator employs multiple strategist functions:
- Technical Strategist: Evaluates decomposition approaches
- Requirements Strategist: Ensures alignment with user intent
- Risk Strategist: Identifies obstacles and failure modes  
- Efficiency Strategist: Seeks simpler solutions
```

**Current State**: Strategists mentioned in PlanAdapter system prompt but not implemented as separate functions

**Impact**: 
- Less robust decision-making synthesis
- Single point of failure in adaptation logic
- Harder to debug/trace adaptation reasoning

**Priority**: Medium - current approach functional but less sophisticated

## 3. Implementation Gaps

### 3.1 Progressive Elaboration üéØ **MAJOR FEATURE**

**Spec Requirement**: Tasks evolve from sketches to complete specifications as they approach execution

**Current Infrastructure Analysis**:
‚úÖ `TaskNode.description` field supports any natural language (perfect foundation!)  
‚úÖ Pathfinder can return modified TaskNodes with refined descriptions  
‚úÖ `_update_task_tree()` function exists for applying changes  

**Missing Components** (captured in FEATURE_ROADMAP.md):
- Task maturity/completeness tracking (`maturity_level` field)
- Attention proximity logic - refinement trigger based on task nearness to execution
- Natural language ‚Üí structured parsing for expanding simple descriptions  
- Task specification templates for "complete" specifications

**Priority**: High Impact - This is infrastructure-ready and should be a major upcoming feature

### 3.2 Dual-Purpose Commit Strategy ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED WORKING**

**Spec Requirement**: 
```
- After every Act: Ensures complete record of environment changes
- After every Adapt: Tracks all plan modifications and refinements
```

**User Feedback**: "I think this kind of is there, in that I believe we call 'record' after Act and Adapt."

**Verification**: ‚úÖ Confirmed! The `record()` function IS called after both Act (line 46) and Adapt (line 59) phases.

**Enhancement Opportunity**: The State Management & Artifacts feature can slot into `record()` by extending it to write structured artifacts before committing. This would provide the detailed traceability envisioned in the specs while building on the existing dual-commit pattern.

### 3.3 Failure Threshold Mechanics

**Model State**: TaskNode includes `failure_threshold: float` (0.0-1.0)

**Missing Implementation**:
- Threshold incrementation after failures
- Parent task escalation at threshold 1.0
- Reset mechanism with new approach

**Impact**: Retry logic incomplete, no adaptive failure handling

**Priority**: High - core to the failure handling philosophy

### 3.4 Task Tree Update Logic

**Current Implementation**: `_update_task_tree()` is overly simplistic
```python
def _update_task_tree(original: TaskNode, updated: TaskNode) -> None:
    # For now, just update the root properties
    original.id = updated.id
    original.description = updated.description
    # ... simple property copying
```

**Missing**: 
- Proper tree merging
- Child node updates and additions
- Conflict resolution

**Impact**: Plan adaptations may not propagate correctly through the tree

**Priority**: High - affects core adaptation functionality

## 4. Architectural Deviations

### 4.1 Single Entry Point Consistency üìù **SPEC UPDATE NEEDED**

**Original Spec Requirement**: `ExecuteTask(spec, environment)` as universal entry point

**Current Implementation**: 
- `execute_task(task_tree: TaskNode, environment_path: str)`
- `execute_project_plan(environment_path: str, task_plan_path: str)`

**User Feedback**: "The current implementation is closer to what I want than the 'Single Entry Point Consistency'. We should massage the original spec to clean this up."

**Resolution**: The two-entry-point pattern (project vs task level) better reflects real usage patterns. Original specification should be updated to match this approach rather than forcing implementation to change.

### 4.2 State Management and Artifacts

**Missing Components**:
```
runs/<run-id>/
  attempt-001/
    act/execution.json
    assess/build_observer.json  
    adapt/pathfinder_decision.json
```

**Impact**: 
- No debugging artifacts
- No execution history
- No audit trail

**Priority**: Medium - affects debugging but not core functionality

### 4.3 Configuration System

**Missing**: 
- `observers.yml` for retry limits and policies
- Per-task overrides capability
- Runtime flags for manual control

**Impact**: Hard-coded policies, less flexible deployment

**Priority**: Low - can be addressed later

## 5. What's Working Well ‚úÖ

### Excellent Agent Architecture
- Clean separation with `BaseClaudeAgent`
- Individual system prompts per agent type
- Shared Claude SDK functionality

### Proper Structured Outputs
- Pydantic models with full type safety
- JSON schema validation via Claude's tool-use
- No `# type: ignore` suppressions needed

### Template System Implementation
- Follows Anthropic's recommended patterns
- XML tags for complex variables
- Clean separation from agent logic

### Multi-Perspective Assessment
- Four perspectives properly defined
- Structured output for each perspective
- Good separation of observation from decision

### Act Phase Distinction
- Correctly limits Act to atomic tasks only
- Parent tasks orchestrate without direct execution
- Both types participate in assessment

## 6. Updated Near-Term Priorities (Based on User Feedback)

## 10. Updated Conclusion

The TEF Light implementation demonstrates strong architectural foundations and correctly implements the core Act‚ÜíAssess‚ÜíAdapt philosophy. The agent architecture is particularly well-designed, following Anthropic's best practices for structured outputs and clean separation of concerns.

**Key Insights from User Feedback**:
- Many "inconsistencies" were intentional design choices for the "light" nature
- The infrastructure for major features (Progressive Elaboration, State Management) is largely in place
- Current dual-commit strategy via `record()` is working as intended
- Two-entry-point pattern is preferred over single universal entry

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Focus on **Progressive Task Elaboration** - infrastructure exists, high impact potential
2. Enhance **State Management & Artifacts** by extending `record()` function  
3. Fix tree update logic for robust plan modifications
4. Deprioritize failure thresholds (nice-to-have status confirmed)

The framework is well-positioned for rapid feature development. The clean separation between specifications, lite implementation, and actual code provides clear guidance for evolution while maintaining the "light" philosophy.
