**Aggregated Assessment Format**:
```json
{
  "execution_id": "task_id",
  "overall_status": "warning",
  "confidence": 0.81,
  "observer_count": 4,
  "observers_run": ["build", "requirements", "quality", "integration"],
  "observations": [...],
  "observer_reports": [...],
  "assessment_summary": "Assessment from 4 observers: warning",
  "assessed_at": "2025-08-22T11:38:20.253022",
  "phase": "Phase 3 - Observer System Implementation"
}
```

### 3.4 Test Assessment Pipeline ✅
**Validation**: Complete multi-observer assessment pipeline tested

- ✅ **4 observers invoked**: All default observers executed successfully
- ✅ **Individual reports generated**: Each observer provided detailed perspective
- ✅ **Aggregation working**: Overall status computed from individual assessments
- ✅ **State persistence**: Full assessment saved to observations.json
- ✅ **Error handling**: Robust observer failure management

**Test Results**:
- **Build Observer**: `pass` status (0.9 confidence) - syntax validation successful
- **Requirements Observer**: `pass` status (0.85 confidence) - acceptance criteria satisfied
- **Quality Observer**: `warning` status (0.7 confidence) - documentation gaps identified
- **Integration Observer**: `pass` status (0.8 confidence) - task boundaries appropriate
- **Overall Assessment**: `warning` status (0.81 average confidence)

## Architecture Enhancements ✅

### Multi-Perspective Assessment Framework
- ✅ **Specialized perspectives**: Each observer focuses on distinct domain expertise
- ✅ **Parallel processing**: Simulated concurrent execution for efficiency
- ✅ **Evidence-based reporting**: Concrete evidence backing all observations

- ✅ **Domain expertise encoding**: Expert knowledge captured in executable instructions
- ✅ **Perspective specialization**: Each observer maintains focused expertise
- ✅ **Consistent interfaces**: Standard JSON output format across all observers
- ✅ **Extensible framework**: Easy addition of new observer perspectives

### Integration with TEF Core

- ✅ **Enhanced assess phase**: `assess_execution()` method upgraded to use observers
- ✅ **State management**: Rich assessment data properly persisted
- ✅ **Agent invoker reuse**: Leverages existing infrastructure for instruction loading
