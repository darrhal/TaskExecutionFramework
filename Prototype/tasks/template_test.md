# Enhanced Template System Test

This task tests the Phase 6.1 enhanced natural language templating system.

## Purpose

Validate that the enhanced templating system provides:

1. **Variable Substitution**: Dynamic content based on task context
2. **Conditional Instructions**: Adaptive behavior based on conditions
3. **Context Injection**: Rich context awareness in agents
4. **Template Inheritance**: Reusable template components

## Test Scenarios

### Variable Substitution
- Task ID, title, and metadata should be properly substituted
- Timestamp and execution context should be injected
- Depth and iteration information should be available

### Conditional Logic
- Different instructions based on task type (atomic vs parent)
- Adaptive behavior based on execution depth
- Special handling for retry scenarios

### Context Awareness
- Agent should have access to full execution context
- Previous execution history should inform current behavior
- Environment state should influence decision making

## Expected Behavior

The enhanced template system should:
1. Load the enhanced executor agent template
2. Process all template variables and conditionals
3. Generate context-aware instructions
4. Execute with improved awareness and adaptability
5. Document the template features used

## Success Criteria

- [x] Enhanced template is loaded and processed
- [x] Variables are substituted correctly
- [x] Conditional blocks execute appropriately  
- [x] Context injection provides rich information
- [x] Agent behavior shows enhanced awareness
- [x] Template features are documented in execution results
