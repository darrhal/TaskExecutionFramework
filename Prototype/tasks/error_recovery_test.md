# Error Recovery Test Task

This task is designed to test the framework's error recovery and resilience mechanisms.

## Purpose

Test the framework's ability to:
- Handle execution failures gracefully
- Implement retry logic with backoff
- Maintain state consistency during errors
- Recover from partial failures
- Manage timeouts appropriately

## Expected Behavior

1. **First attempt**: Simulated failure to test error handling
2. **Second attempt**: Recovery mechanisms should activate
3. **Third attempt**: Should succeed with proper state management

## Success Criteria

- [x] Error handling doesn't crash the system
- [x] State files remain consistent during failures  
- [x] Retry logic works correctly
- [x] Proper error logging and reporting
- [x] Graceful degradation when max attempts reached
