Load the enhanced executor agent template\n2. Process all template variables and conditionals\n3. Generate context-aware instructions\n4. Execute with improved awareness and adaptability\n5. Document the template features used\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [x] Enhanced template is loaded and processed\n- [x] Variables are substituted correctly\n- [x] Conditional blocks execute appropriately  \n- [x] Context injection provides rich information\n- [x] Agent behavior shows enhanced awareness\n- [x] Template features are documented in execution results",
