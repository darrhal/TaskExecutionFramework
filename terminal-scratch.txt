I read through the overview spec and took some notes. Let's work through this together. First organize my thoughts into buckets of issues/decisions we need to tackle, and then let's go through them one by one. Act as a facilitator, allowing me to ponder the concepts and decisions, and make steady progress. We'll want to update the overview spec as we go, once a set of decisions are finalized. Let's wait to update the detailed spec until later.

- The philosophy is less "minimize upfront planning while maximizing execution robustness" and more just "maximizing execution robustness". Although in lower-level calls, maybe it is more fuzzy.
- Let's rename the concept of the "context" in the main function to "environment"
- Not sure how much I like the idea of "fingerprinting" to detect duplicate errors. I guess I just viewed it as a simple "if any given verifier fails more than n times, split up the task". But I guess as long as it doesn't introduce unecessary complexity, and can give a strong gaurantee that it won't do any worse than the naive approach (and might do better), then I will accept this design
- I am really still not satisfied with the stakeholder verification thing, I think. From an abstraction standpoint. And I think my point isn't getting through strong enough about the need to "re-plan as you go". I'm thinking a very agile approach, and I mean agile in the true, conceptual sense. The best metaphor for this is a football player fielding a kickoff and having a plan even before the ball is kicked, and potentially updating it as the ball is in the air, up until the point of catching the kickoff, at which point he starts "executing his plan", but in reality, is still constantly updating the plan based on the new state of the state - where he is, where his teammates and opponents are. The quicker he can adapt, the better his end result will be. From the perspective of this robust task execution framework, one of the key ideas is to put more compute into the process, but mostly directed towards the most valuable areas. I view "constant re-planning" as the key to automatically moving closer to the desired goal with a combination of effort and skill. "work hard and work smart". Alongside, also includin a somewhat basic, common verification approach where different entities review the new state of the environment, in relation to thier perceived desired state, and providing feedback, and something reconciling all the different perspectives. This being the other key means of applying "more compute the problem", in an effective/not completely brute force way.
- Decision 1: No Built-in Sub-agents, Choice: Custom verifier framework instead of Claude Code sub-agents. To clarify, a verifier could be implemented via a sub-agent, but not necessarily.
- Verifiers should be run in parallel, not be a pipeline/staged
- I want to be able to specify the model used in verifiers. In fact, I haven't really seen any detail yet around how to even "implement" a verifier. I fully intend each verifier to be a coded function somewhere, that is called symbolically, which could be as simple as calling an agent/model, or could itself have its own looping and aggregation and voting or whatever.
- I think something that might be missing with this is that the intended "task" fed in at the top level will usually be a task consisting of sub-tasks, and possibly even deeper. So the flow isn't just to try the task and only go deeper if failures lead to splitting, but to feed it a larger, potentially ambiguous task, that has an implied order (or maybe we can find a simple way to specify some tasks can be run in parallel.) And we'd have to have a means of either providing the broken-down sub-tasks in the expected format (I kind of like the idea of "pointers" to files that define the full "spec" for the task), or providing a less structured, potentially inline using natural language as the initial spec, with a model/agent call doing the work of turning it into the expected formal structure.






explain the choice of yaml over json. In general, but also here. Does it work better for structured interfaces between components and function callse


Re-plan after every attempt. Obviously I don't want to go too overboard, so if there's some way to do simple light reviews most of the time, maybe that's what we need, but I need to make sure it's constantly reviewed. Although I'm torn. Retrying based on our policies is a form of adaptation. Maybe we only re-evaluate the plan when we don't have an explicit rule/control flow managing some sub-step. What am I going for here? "gobal consistency"? I also want to make sure we're not completely changing the plan every time. It's more of a "frequent quick re-evaluation with small adjustments". If we were potentially super far of course, the idea is we'd get back on track with a few smaller course corrections. Vs. one big one when we need it, or way to big of one in the majority of cases when we don't.
The "more compute strategically" is really just the philosophy I'm trying to accomplish by the techniques I'm brainstorming here.


1) Basically. Maybe more generically "are the sub-tasks still aligned with the higher level goals/tasks". Because I want everything to be a candidate for change, although, some sense of the original intent has to remain. I guess it's more a realization that the original intent to "change the environment" (what you're trying to "do") could have been incomplete or somewhat inconsistent with the actual state of the environment, therefore, to keep things going automatically, something needs to be reconciled. Maybe that's the most general way of conceptualizing it - reconciliation of currently understood intent against realities of the situation/environment/higher-level objectives.
2) Yeah the "deeper re-evaluation needed" is kind of the idea. I kind of want to incorporate that into the "split task?" decision logic too. Homogonize it. Maybe.
3) I don't know how exactly to implement these ideas that I have, but in general I would say not to this, just because I don't want to get too explicit or rigid 




- Maybe I'm just moving more towards a "softer judge" approach (model/agent call) for making decision. But notably, with as much hard-and-true, exact information, as we have available. With the hope being that if we have a reasonably small set of data, and a focused intent/system prompt/whatever, a model should almost always not do worse than a hard-coded decider, and sometimes do better, or be more complete, or more flexible in its "change of direction" or whatever.
- I almost want to have the "re-planner" verifier/step (maybe it shouldn't be a verifier? Maybe it's so special I should just call it something else?) be, itself, a 2-pass thing, where I figure out some neuro-symbolic algorithm to try, then give it a "you are a hyper-critical engineer who values consistency of the current plan with inferred higher-level intent and you really want to make sure the path we are going down is the right path towards the true goal, and understand that the original words of the original plan may have been typed hastily, without all known knowledge, but in there somewhere is the true intent, or a true best intent based on the misinformed state when capturing the intent". Or, yeah, something like that or better. Basically I want to inject "me" into the pipeline.



I want to emphasize that it's not just about an imperfect original hasty specification. It's about the only way of being able to specify everything up-front is to spend a bunch of cycles before subitting the spec, to make sure you have every detail, all accurate, etc. It's about kicking it off in some direction, and more, better, clearer direction and detail is always better, but it's not the most efficient to scout out every direction up-front. Ooh I like the Navigator. But also strategist. For sure this strategic navigator (maybe we just call it navigator since it's the one steering/driving) should actually modify the plan/task definitions as part of its core role. And we'll want to track a history of this. These plans/task definitions absolutely need to be tracked as files in the repo, so we can commit and track changes in the plan itself this way. Not sure if it's a separate commit for plan changes, or goes along with the other standard commits.
And I don't know for sure, but maybe we do want to keep the "original plan", or literally the exact input provided at the top-level beginning of the run, just to make sure we don't go completely off the rails.



Yep. Just need make sure the "task tree" is fully handled. i.e. if the contents of sub task-001_1 changes, we need to understand/evaluate/modify that. But again, this top-level task is the only special one that keeps the original. We should almost call it something different.
Agreed, separate commits for plan changes.
Yes, let's move onto how it affects the verifier architecture. To start, provide me a summary of the key realizations/decisions so far.



Wonder if the navigator needs to be the official "decider". But maybe this just works, because control flow is purely based on project/task definition structure? I think I really like that. Could we find a way to homogonize this completely, without making it crazy complicated? If we could find a way to specify tasks that can be kicked off in parallel, that would be amazing. But hmm...wonder how that would affect replanning/navigator logic? I guess we could just control the navigation updates to only happen after completion of any "Task/Task.WhenAll"?
Maybe we just call the top-level task the "project"? Maybe with a special schema? But maybe not, the recursive, same function for everything approach appeals to me in many ways. But I've already deviated in this one way, so, maybe...I mean the actual original user-provided input is a very special thing...
Any last thoughts before we update the overview spec with what we've discussed so far? I'd like to do that soon, and then move onto the next conversation topics.



We made some updates to the doc in another thread, to add some progressive disclosure, mainly for the human reader. Let's keep this format. But continuing on where we were, I have some more thoughts and comments:

- I'm starting to get a better feel for the overall approach, which I love. And I like the way the approach is coming together
- Not completely sure about the flow "Execute → Verify → Navigate → Reconcile → Adapt". Nothing wrong per se, but it doesn't quite land somehow. We'll see what I discover as I continue to read. Some random alternatives to get the ideas flowing: act/do/modify, observe/measure/review, change course/re-plan. But let's clean this up. "reconcile intent with current reality" is part of the process of navigating. After verify it's almost a "steer" step, with reconciliation being part of the process of deciding where to steer, and task/plan adaptation being the means to do the steering.

- This may be an unwarranted fear, but the idea of a "spec" being not just concrete text, but text with pointers to other text, needs to be reliable.
- Wondering now if we need to rename "verifier". What would the alternatives be? Feedback,  measure, ...?
- I'm kind of seen a sensors/controller pattern emerge. Not sure where to go with this, but just an observation for now.
- Not sure if we've captured this yet, or if we need to in any way, but I imagine, much like I've mentioned before about the "implementation" of verifiers, the orchestrator should explicitly loop through tasks/do some things "symbolically" based on the explicit/symbolic input, in addition to potentially some "fuzzy" decision making. Which makes me wonder how the orchestrator and navigator play together. Are they the same thing given this perspective?
- How does the task format, or other things we have updated, affect our history tracking format? maybe we're good, just wondering about naming/organizing the files, the types (environment change/plan change), id's, etc.
- I wasn't thinking we'd keep an "original" task definition for anything other than the plan. I could see maybe. But I'd be concerned about first off, only the "project" instructions are user-defined, and secondly, I don't want to restrict plan changes to conform to newer versions of sub-tasks/any tasks. A replan could just be a complete wipe out of the previous sub-tasks. Ok I guess, what we should retain, is the "original" documents, if they were originally provided by the user. If they were generated as part of the agential process, then no.



# Task Execution Framework - Continued Development

  ## Context
  Working on the Task Execution Framework (TEF) - a robust orchestration system that maximizes execution robustness through progressive elaboration and continuous reconciliation.

  ## Key Documents
  - `Specs/FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md` - Updated overview with our latest decisions

  ## Recent Key Decisions
  1. **Navigator Component**: Strategic decision maker that reconciles intent with reality and refines task definitions during execution
  2. **Progressive Elaboration**: Plans evolve during execution rather than requiring perfect upfront specification
  3. **Parallel Verifiers**: Information gatherers, not decision makers
  4. **Project/Task Structure**: Top-level "project" preserves original intent; all tasks can evolve
  5. **Terminology**: "environment" (not context), "reconciliation" as core concept

  ## Remaining Topics to Discuss
  - Fingerprinting complexity vs. simple failure counting
  - Verifier implementation details (model selection, coded functions)
  - Natural language input → formal spec conversion
  - Handling hierarchical tasks with implied/explicit ordering
  - Technical specification updates

  ## Current Focus
I read through the overview spec come more and took some notes. Let's work through this together. First organize my thoughts into buckets of issues/decisions we need to tackle, and then let's go through them one by one. Act as a facilitator, allowing me to ponder the concepts and decisions, and make steady progress. We'll want to update the overview spec as we go, once a set of decisions are finalized.

I like the act->sense-adjust. It's very generic. Almost too much, but we can rename it later. Agreed, reconciliation is part of the implementation of adjust, and I think we can keep the conceptual hierarchy multi-level, to retain this important observation


It might make sense to keep them different. The orchestrator is our code to set it all in motion, and keep it all going. It orchestrates the main 3-step outer loop. It is the engine. The navigator just refines the path for the engine to move along. So actually I think this aligns with your option C. And I think I'd lean towards controller as the name, although really it's just the guts of the main actual method, FWIW, I believe.

Yes! I love the how vs. what observation. I'm questioning my decision from earlier. Sense is just so abstract. Act I'm kind of ok with, sense, not so much, adjust a little more so. But I'm really wondering if there are better terms. I want to hover on this all for a moment. I want something that converys generality, but still hints at it being something flavored for a intellectual work workflow. Not literal, physical acting and sensing and adjusting.



Act → Assess → Adapt. Controller is good. Sensors just doesn't quite land. Reviewers, analyzers, are ok. Observers??  I need some more ideas.

Let's go with observers for now. I'm coming closer to that concept.



Not sure I have a concern. If you don't have a concern, I don't, and we can dive into the details later. Was just a thought. Let me know what you think would work and we can move on.


- Seems ok overall. Just wondering if we want to name these to be consistent with our other terminology. Act/Assess/Adapt, and so on. I had basically called what we call "Act" now, "Runs" before. Also I'm contemplating the hierarchical structure of the runs file/folder organization. Wondering if flat is better. Not sure I have an opinion yet, but it came to mind.
- Somewhat tangential topic, and I'm not sure if this was retained in our current conversation's context, but I kind of like the idea of having the navigator being a potentially "complex" set of more than 1, maybe even more than 2, distinct personalities/personas/stakeholder roles all doing an "evaluation" of the re-planning/navigation step, much like the framework is set up for the "verifiers" or whatever we're calling it now.
- Maybe it makes sense to structure the outputs based on our Act/Asses/Adapt terminology? We wouldn't have anything to commit after assess, but the history tracking via files could retain it in that organizational structure.


Let's the the hierarchical option you suggested. And yes, let's formalize the multi-persona navigator like you've suggested. And note that any of these could/should be explictly defined functions we create, much like the observers. We'll have to come up with a standard way to configure these in the future, but to start, my own hard-coded logic + my own calls to agents and my own hard-coded flows will suffice.


I'm just not sure hashing will work. This will be very free-form, for most observer feedback. I hear you on option C, but I think the more natural buckets are the type of observers themselves. Which themselves should just be a simple count of failures. So if build fails 4 times, something is wrong, and the whole action itself should be backed out - but notably, not the whole entire "project". The failure of any sub-task should just trigger another "adapt" and subsequent next action, whatever that is. Anyway, not sure we if captured that clearly yet or not. But then back to our example, maybe build has 4 max retries, but other types have fewer. Or more. Not sure how we'd configure that, but that's how I see it right now.




It's worth noting though that observers don't really retry, they just observe. So something in the controller/navigator has to decide that. I guess what we're talking about here is the navigator following some explicit programming here to do retries, in addition to whatever other pieces of an algorithm it implements, explicit or soft. But notably the observers should be the ones declaring their retry count, I think. Or some global config maybe.

Speaking of that, we have some more terminology reconciliation to do. Symbolic/neural. Explicit/soft. Logic/intuition.

And now I'm seeing your comment about observer implementation details. I just don't really know right now. I need some help exploring this. It kind of relates to the previous topic and my notes I just captured above.



Yeah I suppose if we have explicit logic, it kind of always needs to be followed. It's just that the explicit logic could account for "in-between" cases where, maybe again, based on configuration, something falls under some retry/whatever threshold, and above another, but we allow these middle ground cases to be judged softer by feeding whatever data we have towards an LLM to decide. But maybe this is too complicated to start out. It should probably be either explicit or softly judged. I'm not even sure what the soft judge case would look like - I guess that means, what to we feed into the context of the llm? In what order? How do we build all the up and present the right question. It's all doable. So maybe we can note these options as implementation considerations for observers, but start off with just this simple explicit retry logic. Yeah I don't know. Maybe I'm getting too far ahead. Or maybe I'm not thinking of this right. It's the navigator that has to do this. That's it's job. Ok yeah now I'm confused - what does the re-planning again? The navigator? I think I'm just confused because I never really loved that term given the recent terminology decisions. After reading the rest of your response though, maybe you're on the right track with the controller/navigator collaboration thoughts? I don't know, I need some help getting my thoughts back on track here, to really hone in on the correct parts of this to attend to right now.


How does the controller get fed what it's working on though? Does the navigator call the main function/the controller based on its new next first step in the newly determined/potentially modified plan of attack? Does the controller just take the output from observe and feed that into the navigator call? I'm actually struggling with that, and the fact that the pseudo navigate method you have is hard-coded to make decisions based on build observations, and presumably other, but I feel like this should be more of a plugin design. But no idea how that would work. The observer would have to observe, but then also provide an implementation for how to decide what to do about the errors/warnings/whatever. Or maybe not the observer itself, but some handler for that type of observer. And in most cases, that would be something like, if there's an error, feed back that feedback to another "act" call to try again. But would this be accomplished via creating a new head task, and then looping back to the start, the same old generic workflow, but with the new plan that includes the first step with the instructions generated with the feedback from the observer. I mean that all makes good sense I think, so where does this retry thing come in? It's possible I'm just discovering holes in my initial ideas, and that's fine, but maybe I'm just forgetting something.


Let's rename CodeTaskAgent to ExecuteTask. But this helped me see some of the flow. But I feel like we're missing the top-level loop that loops through all sub-tasks. Or maybe there has to be some special handling of non-root node tasks, where they don't actually do any acting themselves (or I guess they could, but probably not, that wouldn't make sense), but they could have some top-level verification/observation checks.
I also feel like we've lost the key feature of frequent, constant re-planning with this flow. Or maybe I'm missing something. It looks like we're not adapting the plan itself by looking far and wide for consistency and alignment with goals. We're just calling a "decide" function.


We've been working on the @Specs\FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW spec together, and are making some progress. You are acting as a facilitator, allowing me to ponder the concepts and decisions. We've been making steady progress as we untangle and re-arrange the concepts, and periodically update the spec by interweaving the updated concepts into it.

Let's work on the first pending topic. I'm struggling to reconcile the ideas I have in my head for how the general execution flow will go with the realities of coding it up. I'm wondering if we need to somehow create a system where you/I can capture the flow, the sequences if you will, that would allow me to review it more concretely. Maybe mermaid diagrams, or pseudo code. What do you think?


I wonder what the "environment" concretely actually is here. A diff, a pointer to the base directory? Claude code already inherently runs based on a base directory, and I suppose that's something we're probably even required to pass in when we call the sdk, so maybe that's the answer?
This adapt phase that's actually right now a "decision" or a "refine" ("replan"?)...the core idea here is that we want a re-evaluation of the whole plan after every step we take. This idea is so fundamental that we should call it out in the spec, in detail.  Regarding these fundamental ideas/metaphors: (The football player fielding a kickoff and planning from the start before he even gets the ball and re-planning based on the changing environment of the players on the field coming towards him and the moving forward with the plan once he catches the ball and the constant re-planning as he change position and the objects in his environment change position) and (the not-paint by numbers metaphor where you start with a vague idea, and instead of planning out exactly what you want to paint before you get started, you start with a fuzzy sketch, an outline and fill in the details as you go). I want these actually concretely spelled out in the spec, because they are fundamental metaphors. I might even want to start with modeling these sequences with actual mermaid and pseudo code. I think the football one is more true to the ideas we've come up with so far, and the non-paint by numbers is different, but maybe it's worth exploring both before I proceed any further. Actually maybe the painting one works The user-provided project/task hierarchy is the high-level sketch and then any details, their vision, that they happen to feel confident about up-front. Yeah, I think we need to deviate for a bit to explore these flows from a mermaid/pseudo code perspective.



I like the "entire **remaining** plan" note. That's critical. Obviously in hindsight, but you can't change your past actions (or at least not with the context of this - maybe in the future we could have a "reset" option to "go back in time").


I want incorporate the idea that the in these real-world examples, the "plan" typically includes the most concrete specificity for the near-term task(s), and a rougher outline for the most distant ones, but any good plan involves, or essentially is, a best-guess for how to get from point A (current situation) to point B (end goal), and, notably, point B might not be super concrete (e.g. "42 yard line"), if it's only a sub-goal to a larger concrete goal ("win the game"), hence the need for re-planning risk/reward evaluation calculations in the attempt to improve the probability of achieving the end-goal. Granted, modeling this flow could potentially be very complicated and difficult, but I can't help but wonder if we can get pretty close. Let's update our document to attempt to capture this flow for both our examples in the mermaid diagrams. Let's remove the pseudo code for now.



I'm back at it, trying to refine the concepts laid out in the FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md spec. I kind of went back to the beginning, and started writing out, in my own words, what this is/what it should be. What I need your help with now is reviewing the current state of the document, then reading my words below, to help facilitate some updates to the document that keeps it in generally its current form, but reconciles and updates its contents with the important clarifications inferred from my thoughts below:


I have an environment. I have an original set of instructions, which could be labeled as a project plan, which in reality is just a top-level task with a (potentially imperfect/incomplete) description of its goals, and a hierarchy of sub-tasks that detail an initial path to start traversing in order to accomplish the project goals. The sub-tasks also implicitly contain additional information about the true, underlying goals of the project. My desire is to initiate an agential workflow, by providing the project plan, and a pointer to the environment (folder/local repo), that will change the environment in the ways specified in the project plan.

The agential workflow should consist of 3 primary steps, executed in a loop, until success or failure is signaled at the top level. Act->Assess->Adapt.

Act will take place only when we reach a leaf-node task, with no children, that directly specifies an intended goal, with a definition of the desired goal and a means of measuring success of the goal. Each task definition should implement a structured schema that allows for uniform Act, Assess, and Adapt cycles. Initial sketches of any given task, whether provided in the initial project plan, or generated by the agential workflow, do not need to include a complete, structured task spec. They can be as simple as a brief task description, or goal. As the execution of the workflow progresses and a task becomes closer to becoming the active, working task, our process (via what we currently call the navigator) may update the task spec with more detail, or may update the existing spec in any way based on the new state of the environment and the rest of the plan. The navigator should pay closest attention to the nearest upcoming planned tasks, with the requirement that it review a task and build up a complete spec, with the highest quality of detail it can, for the immediate next task.

Assess should take place up completion of the Act, for every task, including atomic leaf tasks, and composite tasks that have a goal, but no direct Act execution outside of their child tasks.

Adapt should modify the existing plan in-place, as necessary. A key example of how it would do this is by, if the data from the Asses phase indicates a need for more action, it would create a new task at the front of the line, seeded with the appropriate details, such as similar goals as the previously executed task, possibly slightly improved, and marked with an "attempt" counter incremented by one from the previous attempt (initial attempts would be seeded with 1 for the attempt counter). The adapt step, and in particular the re-planning step,  is the centerpoint to this agential workflow. The re-planner must take into account the feedback from the assess step re-evaluate the entire plan. To make this step robust, the re-planning step will itself consist of multiple parallel evaluations of the results from Assess, by critiquing it from different angles, for different reasons, and to analyze the results from different perspectives, essentially converting the assessment data to instructions on how to modify the plan. I could see this implement as a simple set of "personas" assigned to evalute different parts of the plan. One being, "what's the next step?", another being, "do all the tasks in the plan and the hierarchy/order they are planned for have consistency between them as a whole", and another "do any top-level or near-term upcoming tasks need to be refined or built out more?" and "how does the plan and its current progress align with the original intent as specified in the project specs". So this is another version of "Multi-Perspective Assessment" but it's more like "multi-perspective plan assessment". Looking at the environment, the changes, and the current plan from multiple perspectives, all in pursuit of a better, more refined, more complete, plan, than before the assessment.

Some other notes:
- Commit after every action, and also commit after every change to the plan. I think we mostly have this covered already, but I just really keep trying to find the right terminology/concepts to use for the re-planning. There's this idea about what the "navigator" "is" that doesn't sit right. There's some component here that, metaphorically speaking, is simply digging a little trench in the sand for the stream of water to flow towards. That's what the plan is - a probably path we'll take, but we want to easily cover up and smooth out the old path, and instead create a new best-path, easily, because we should plan on potentially doing it often.



That was really good. Some more thoughts to help me reconcile:

- Leaf tasks->atomic tasks, I think. Let me know if you agree or have any really good alternatives.
- I want to make it clear that task specs should not be updated after act/completion
- Execution Assessment->Action Assessment? Not sure, let me know if you find improvement/changes here worth the cost of our attention.
- "Phase" is definitely the right word for Act/Assess/Adapt
- These assessment/observer types...I feel like the "plugin" approach could just be them sitting in an "observers" (or whatever) folder, and the behavior can come from their name, specified intent. Maybe there's some structure here, and maybe could even include some pseudo-code, or actual code, that essentially instructs to act/flow in a certain way, or maybe literally tries to write and execute its own code in the loop/whatever that's described.
- The Navigator Decision Types section...I think I'm leaning less towards this tiered type of approach, and more towards a normalized abstraction, where even simple retries are potentially realized by, in simple terms, "copying the existing task, adding 1 to the attempt counter, putting it to the front of the task list, marking the last one as complete (+finishing it off like any other, e.g. commit, etc.), providing the condensed/summarized/analyzed/all feedback from the assess step, maybe tweaking the goal but probably not, and just trying again with the new state of the state and the feedback. Or maybe in some cases, reverting the change from the act step, and just going into the copy of the task with a heads-up of what happened when it tried something the first time. Although, it would probably be good for it to know what it tried, so why revert then, if it can essentially inspect the diff for that and try again with the feedback."
- I think the Core Execution Loop should call out that a git commit should happen right after act, and another separate one after adapt
- Adapt Phase Decisions: I think this needs to be softer. Or maybe it just doesn't align with the homogenized abstraction where the adapt just modifies the plan (or not if there's nothing to modify), and control flow always occurs by continuing on with the next step in the plan after this re-plan step. Unless it's literally the last task, in which case, the whole process completes.


- Still struggling with "Navigator"...
  - Scout
  - Trailblazer
  - ...Maybe, so we don't get pulled too far off track, provide me with what you think the right question to ask is, as it relates to my pursuit of the correct terminology and componentization here...




I made a few manual edits to the doc. Otherwise, it's getting closer. And I finally landed on my preferred term for navigator: Pathfinder. I want it to convey that the best plan is produced by a "search" for the optimal plan, based on what we know right now. So let's go with Pathfinder. Let's update the document to reflect. And also help me asses whether any of the current language in the doc might be worth tweaking, given this new, potentially slight different concept, or abstraction.



Do we have any open issues, decisions, or discussion points that have been noted but not addressed?



We've made a lot of progress refining the Specs/FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md document. I think the general big picture is coming together, but there may be some key missing pieces still. Certainly, there are more implementation-level details that would need to be ironed out. But what if we were to try to plow ahead right now with a prototype, just given what we know now? I kind of want to try this out, and specifically, try it out with very minimal actual explicit programming, instead favoring "natural language programming", if you will. Think agent instructions, maybe sub-agents, maybe writing out temp files with sub-agent calls and writing pseudo code or simple checklists or something (or whatever might work, I don't really care, these are just some initial ideas) and that would allow us to loop back to the main agent and, in a way, allow it to keep going indefinitely until complete, or more specifically, this would just allow us to implement the ideas around the agential flow/framework we've come up with. What would this take? You should research this hard, searching for documentation on claude code sdk, mcp servers maybe, claude code itself, sub-agents, and anything and everything that might matter. You should think extremely hard about all this, really iterate on it, and see if you can come up with some really solid ideas, and eventually maybe a concrete plan, for how to achieve this prototype idea.




Let's start executing Phase 1 of the plan found at Prototype/Implementation_plan.md. Read and understand the Specs/FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md file, and the rest of the documents in the Prototype folder. Think hard about what you're doing, and let me know if you need any clarifications.



Can you do a brief review of the implementation plan, to verify that everything you've done is marked as done?


/compact Also, consider this approach: Please condense this conversation ...


Read the overview spec and prototype implementation plan. Continue the implementation plan but stop after you complete phase 7. Think hard and critically on this. Take inspiration from the framework principles themselves to really make sure you implement the intent of the framework.



Why did you say 'The Task Execution Framework now embodies its core principle: "Think hard and critically on this. Take inspiration from the framework principles themselves to really make sure you implement the intent of the framework."'? I never said that. That's not its core principle. Fuck you.

Check off the tasks in the plan if they are done



We've detailed some concepts around an agential task execution framework, which you can see in FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md. We also implemented a prototype as seen in the /Prototype1 folder. Don't bother looking through how it was implemented, but it might be worth seeing the plan that was created and followed: Implementation_plan.md. This ended up being too complicated. It should have been a much simpler framework to really test-drive the workflow. Let's iterate together on a new plan that really captures the essence of the workflow, but is simple enough to review and digest at a high level. Think hard about ways we could reduce the surface area of this light prototype, while keeping the core concepts in place. I'm wondering if we can accomplish this with a simple sub-agent architecture. And the observers and pathfinder strategists are just a list of instructions to be followed on a one-pass call to a sub-agent.


No testing. I said to not look at how it was implemented. I said we should iterate together, not jump into it like a hyper piece of shit.



We need different observer types, but we will get that by listing out a set of instructions for a single sub-agent to  review it from those vantage points
If you mean git commits, I definitely want to keep the state persistence between runs. But you must mean something else?
Yes I think we need to keep the task queue system, because I think if we really nail that down, it will actually be the simplest way to do it




1) yes mostly. But it would have potentially more/better detail. Which is easy enough to add/tweak later once the structure is there.
2) Ok, yes, I want all the run/history tracking. It doesn't seem like it would be that hard. Do a task, follow the flow, which includes logging history and git commits, as detailed. All those parts of the flow should stay.

The core loop description is really good. I LOVE the "pop the task" comment. But 4 needs to be deeper. I wonder if what I've been trying to discover here is just that we probably can get reasonbly close, and, hopefully, pretty reliable, implementation of loops and hierarchical task management, by just managing a task queue...and...that it?? So for instance, for step 4, if I want to make that more robust, I could have the instructions for the agent be to create and enqueue a list of 4 tasks at the start of the tasks queue. I could even have natural language control flow such as "if the configuration indicates deep analysis, write out all 4, otherwise just the 2 main ones". So this step 4 is really critical, but maybe the simplicity of this approach (or some other ideas you have - this is one of the big things I'm asking you for) allows us to figure this out later. One key missing piece now though is, how do we communicate between the sub-agent calls? In other words, many of them will be instructed, via a prompt, to return some result, such as their analysis, in, hopefully, some structured format (such as our errors/warnings for the observers, for example). And others will be asked to "do" something, but even in those cases, we'd probably want some sort of feedback after completion. Including maybe specific pointers to what changed, but it doesn't really matter, the point is, there needs to be a mechanism to have the sub-agent calls effectively as as a function call. It's very analagous to the .NET Task and Task<T> class, in that we really always return **something**. Maybe the sub-agent spec supports this? Otherwise, we're back to using the sdk, but i just don't think we need that to start, even if we have to hack something for the prototype.
Maybe what I'm realizing here is that we could probably do a pretty good job of demonstrating this flow using just a handful of agent/.md files or whatever they're stored in, if these fundamental criteria turn out to have a solution to. I guess that's simply, "how do we call sub-agents, as if they are functions, and have them reliably return data in a structure/format we expect?"
Thoughts? I think I'd like to move forward with you really trying to guide me through the process of refining this conceptualization. Lead me. What do you thing? What are the key concepts to my rambling? Do you think there is something here? Be honest.




Right, the queueu is the control flow. But the agent calls making decisions about how to change the queue is then the real control flow.
And see, this is the part I think we really need to dive into now: does the sub-agent spec support and sort of standard with for input/output? Or should be standardize on the sdk? Overall, that seems like the leading approach. Or should we make an MCP? I don't think so, but this is all closely related. I defintely don't want to re-invent any wheel here. I want you to research this. 

And for sure, the queue itself should be committed. That's the "Git commit after EVERY action AND after EVERY plan change" decision.



What is the "The Task tool we have available"? Our thing we designed? Or something else? Just curious. I'm 100% sold on the sdk approach. What should we think through next? I'm not ready to dive into implementing.




I've stressed this many times in our conversations, and will here again: The most fundamental piece of this, other than the basic loop/flow, is deep, thorough, frequent re-evaluation of the "plan" (which is what our task queue with pointers etc is), from multiple angles. In fact - slight deviation - maybe queue isn't the right data structure. I mean, what we're talking about here is implement a data structure (currently a queue) on disk, with pointers or names or something. But no, I want this to be a hierarchy of tasks, including the ability to define "composite tasks" (this description doesn't seem right - let's clean it up) that basically state that they can be executed in parallel.
So yeah, your "basic queue operations" is on the right track, but it should be...what data structure?
You're asking about "how minimal can we make tasks while still being useful". I feel like all we're trying to do at this point - literally - is mimic a pure function call with input/output contract, whatever we would do if we were explicitly coding it up. I think we should focus in on this part right now, and leave the specific algorithms for deep observation and deep "pathfinder" implementation until later - just minimally stubbed out for now, but with the framework in place to implement whatever we want later. So let's do that. But first, please re-read the FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md file, to make sure you are in touch with the real, true, key concepts, and why they are key.

Maybe there is no parallel task. We just need the children to be a List<Task> or List<Task[]>? I guess your pseudo code is just one way of realizing that.
Key point here: there is no spec. The plan **is** the spec, and this spec/plan, the entire thing (including the completed tasks) is the thing that explictly and/or implicitly captures everything about what the goal is and how it's currently planned on being achieved. And this entire structure should be reviewed, thoroughly and completely, every..single...time.

And I'm not sure context applies. The repo/folder is the context, is the environment. It probably can be "implicitly" passed in the main execute task method, but outside of that, this all should be conceptualized as stateless, pure functions. Plus the Task definition is a definition, not a function anyways.

And I just had another realization. To make the "retry" feature a little easier to manage, let's make it softer than passing in "attempts". We should instead do something more like "failure...threshold??...failure bar??"...something that we raise after essentially retrying things, to the extent that it indicates something more major, outside of our task, needs to change, in order to stop running into the same/similar walls...

And again, the execute_agent call (this is the execute task call from our concepts, yes/no?) should just take the task, and implicitly, needs to be called within the context of an "environment".

This is getting close, and I really want to see what this would actually look like in a runnable implementation, even if the sdk calls are just stubbed out at first. But we also should note that we really need to include some ability to retain all original user intent - in a read-only immutable folder probably. That should be simple enough to do - the initial user-initiation of the agent involves creating this task hierarchy, calling the agent by pointing to its location on disk, then the agent copies it to some "internal" folder (probably alongside it, but the main point is it's for the agent, not a human, to modify). I also really want a way to be able to pause the execution of the agent and add details to the immutable/human-intent area, before continuing. We can figure out how to pause it later, but I think that points to the need to be able to capture the user-provided "plan" in the same format as the agent plan/task-tree specification. Maybe we would plan to have step 0 of the project process be to build up a plan in whatever format makes sense (one .md with actual task/check box hierarchies, or whatever), and we have claude code or some model or agent help us get it into the correct technical structure (we may need something like that anyways as a form of enforcing structure?)
This threshold thing should be 0-100%.
I still think we need to define a format for defining a task tree on disk. Seems like that would be a simple exercise for you.
I'm not feeling confident that you're really grasping the full scope of what we're trying to accomplish here. Now might be the time to write out a spec for what we really are trying to do here with the second prototype. Please try to capture this all at a high level, but that includes the important concepts from the original spec, and the things we've talked about here today.


Each task should be its own file, I think. But maybe not. I guess we could just view it as the whole project serialized to json. I think maybe the id should be system-generated though. Not sure if we need a status.
Let's call it there for now. Take these final comments and write out the spec, but not so detailed that it will give me a headache.


Good. Now I want you to review the document and pull out anything that's more detailed technical implementation plans, and move them to a new .md for that. Retain some semblence of a high-level description, but details sucha s code examples do not belong in the overview doc.


We need to review the implementation around how the claude code sdk is called. Specifically, it seems like we might not be taking advantage of the structured output capabilities. I believe you can instruct the sdk to use actual json for its ouptut. But I also think there's yaml too. Read the latest official anthropic docs on this, and let's figure out how to improve it. Also, pull in the original larger, more detailed overview spec at ./Specs/FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md. I think we talked about using yaml frontmatter or something. If you don't find that, let me know, and I can try to find our notes where we discussed this.



We need to add state tracking/whatever to the commit (record) area, based on specs. Might need to review full spec also to get that right.
