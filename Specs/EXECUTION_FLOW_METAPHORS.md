# Execution Flow Metaphors - Continuous Re-planning Architecture

## Context

This document captures the fundamental execution philosophy of the Task Execution Framework (TEF) through two key metaphors. The TEF is a control system that maximizes execution robustness through continuous re-planning and progressive elaboration, rather than requiring perfect upfront specifications.

<details>
<summary>üí° <strong>Why These Metaphors Matter</strong></summary>

Traditional execution models follow a linear path: Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Verify. Our framework embraces a different philosophy: every action reveals information that improves the next action. These metaphors help visualize how continuous adaptation isn't a fallback strategy - it IS the strategy.

**üéØ ELI5:** Instead of following a recipe exactly, you taste as you cook and adjust. Instead of following GPS blindly, you look at traffic and adjust your route. The framework works the same way - it gets smarter with every step.
</details>

## Core Principle: Continuous Re-planning

The fundamental insight is that we re-evaluate the entire plan after EVERY atomic action. This is not a failure mode - this IS the mode. Traditional execution follows "Plan ‚Üí Execute All ‚Üí Check Success", but our execution follows:

- Start with fuzzy initial plan
- Execute one atomic action
- Re-evaluate ENTIRE remaining plan
- Execute next atomic action
- Re-evaluate ENTIRE remaining plan
- Repeat until complete

Each execution reveals information that makes the next plan better.

<details>
<summary>üîÑ <strong>Understanding Continuous Re-planning</strong></summary>

This is the heart of the framework. Unlike traditional systems that create a detailed plan and try to execute it perfectly, we expect and embrace change. Every single action we take teaches us something, and we immediately use that knowledge to improve our approach.

**üîÑ ELI5:** Like walking through a dark room with a flashlight. Each step forward reveals more of the room, and you adjust your path based on what you see. You don't need to map the entire room before starting - you figure it out as you go.
</details>

## Metaphor 1: Football Kickoff Return

The kickoff returner embodies continuous re-planning. They have an initial plan before catching the ball, but they re-evaluate and adjust with literally every step based on the changing field.

        Blockers-->>Returner: Gap opening on left

        Returner->>Returner: Refine next 3 concrete steps
        Returner->>Returner: Adjust distant rough plan based on new info
    end
    
    Note over Returner: END-GOAL achieved or SUB-GOAL completed
```


<details>
<summary>üèà <strong>What This Teaches Us</strong></summary>

The kickoff return shows us that:
1. **Planning happens continuously** - not just at the beginning
2. **Every action provides new information** - each step reveals the field differently  
3. **Multiple perspectives matter** - like having different strategists
4. **Adaptation is normal** - changing plans isn't failure, it's intelligence
5. **Commitment is incremental** - we commit each step, not the entire path

**üèà ELI5:** The runner doesn't decide their entire path before catching the ball. They decide one step at a time, and each step helps them decide the next one better. That's exactly how our framework operates.

## Metaphor 2: Progressive Painting (Not Paint-by-Numbers)

An artist creating an original painting starts with a rough sketch and progressively adds detail. The painting itself teaches the artist what it needs - each brushstroke reveals possibilities for the next one.

    Note over Artist: This is the initial spec
    
    Artist->>Canvas: Create rough sketch
    Note over Canvas: Planning granularity established

        Artist->>Artist: Does it match the vision?
        
        Note over Artist: SUB-GOAL evaluation
        Artist->>Artist: Check: Sky section progress (complete cloud layer)
        Artist->>Artist: Check: Color temperature consistency
        
        Note over Artist: ADAPT phase - Planning informed by completion

        alt SUB-GOAL achieved
            Artist->>Artist: REPLAN: Sky complete, focus on mountains
            Note over Artist: CONCRETE: Next 3 strokes (mountain silhouette)

        else Discovered opportunity
            Artist->>Artist: REPLAN: Add birds (enhances composition)
            Note over Artist: NEW SUB-GOAL: Add 2-3 birds in upper sky
            Note over Artist: CONCRETE: Small dark shapes, simple forms
        else Area needs refinement
            Artist->>Artist: REPLAN: More cloud detail needed
            Note over Artist: CONCRETE: Next 2 strokes (cloud highlights)
            Note over Artist: Keep distant mountain plan rough
        else Completion informs next area
            Artist->>Artist: REPLAN: Sky warmth affects mountain colors
            Note over Artist: Update rough plan: Mountains need cooler tones
            Note over Artist: CONCRETE: Start mountain base with purple
        end
        
        Note over Artist: Update planning granularity
        Artist->>Artist: Define next 2-3 concrete brushstrokes
        Artist->>Artist: Adjust rough plan for distant areas
        Artist->>Artist: Refine SUB-GOALS based on progress
        
        Note over Artist: The vision evolves with the work
        Artist->>User: Still aligned with intent?
        User-->>Artist: Yes, and I like how it's developing
    end
    
    Note over Painting: END-GOAL achieved when vision is realized
```


<details>
<summary>üé® <strong>What This Teaches Us</strong></summary>

The painting metaphor shows us that:
1. **Specifications are sketches** - starting points, not blueprints
2. **Work reveals requirements** - you discover needs by doing
3. **Vision evolves with execution** - the plan gets better as you work
4. **Earlier work may need revision** - based on what you learn later
5. **Completion is recognized, not predetermined** - you know it when you see it

**üé® ELI5:** You can't plan every brushstroke before starting a painting. Each stroke you make shows you what the next one should be. The painting "tells you" what it needs. Our framework works the same way with code.
</details>

## The Environment: Learning Context

The Environment is the concrete runtime context that evolves with execution. It has a simple structure but captures discovered knowledge:

**Static Context** (what we know at start):
- Base directory (required by Claude SDK)
- Working directory (can change during execution)
- Git root location

**Discovered Context** (what we learn by doing):
- Things we learned the hard way (discovered constraints)
- Things that worked (successful patterns)
- Relationships we discovered (dependency graph)
- Our trail of breadcrumbs (execution history)

**Available Capabilities**:
- Detected tools, languages, and frameworks

The key insight is that the Environment gets smarter with each execution, learning from both successes and failures to inform better decisions over time.

<details>
<summary>üåç <strong>Understanding the Environment</strong></summary>

The Environment is not just a static configuration - it's a living context that learns and evolves. It starts simple (just a directory) but accumulates knowledge with every action. This learned context informs better decisions over time.

**üåç ELI5:** Like how you learn a new neighborhood. At first you just know your address. But as you explore, you learn which streets connect, where the shortcuts are, which coffee shop is best. The environment "remembers" what it learns.
</details>

## How These Metaphors Connect

Both metaphors teach the same lesson from different angles:

**Continuous Re-planning**:
- Football: Re-evaluate path with every step
- Painting: Each brushstroke informs the next

**Progressive Elaboration**:
- Football: Path becomes clearer as you advance
- Painting: Details emerge through the work

**Planning Granularity**:
- Football: Concrete next 3 steps, rough distant direction
- Painting: Concrete next brushstroke, rough idea for distant areas

**Sub-goals vs End-goals**:
- Football: First down/field position vs win game
- Painting: Complete sky section vs cohesive painting

**Multiple Perspectives**:
- Football: Different strategists for robust decisions
- Painting: Composition, color, vision, opportunity

**Risk/Reward Re-planning**:
- Football: Evaluate tackle risk vs yard gain potential
- Painting: Balance detail effort vs overall composition needs

**Adaptation is Normal**:
- Football: Changing direction isn't failure
- Painting: Revising earlier work is part of the process

**Reality Teaches**:
- Football: The field shows you the path
- Painting: The canvas tells you what it needs

## Act ‚Üí Assess ‚Üí Adapt: The Universal Pattern

Both metaphors follow the same three-phase cycle:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Act[ACT<br/>One Atomic Action] --> Assess[ASSESS<br/>Gather Observations]
    Assess --> Adapt[ADAPT<br/>Re-plan Everything]
    Adapt --> Act
    
    style Act fill:#e8f5e9
    style Assess fill:#fff3e0
    style Adapt fill:#e3f2fd
```

### In Football Terms:
- **Act**: Take one step
- **Assess**: Where are defenders/blockers/gaps?
- **Adapt**: Choose next step based on entire field

### In Painting Terms:
- **Act**: Apply one brushstroke
- **Assess**: How does it look? What emerged?
- **Adapt**: Decide next stroke based on whole painting

### In Framework Terms:
- **Act**: Execute one task (leaf) or orchestrate (parent)
- **Assess**: Run observers for multiple perspectives
- **Adapt**: Navigator re-plans based on discoveries, with concrete near-term steps and rough distant plans

<details>
<summary>‚ôªÔ∏è <strong>The Cycle That Drives Everything</strong></summary>

This three-phase cycle is the heartbeat of the framework. It runs at every level - from individual code changes to entire project orchestration. The key insight is that Adapt doesn't just fix problems - it improves the plan based on new information.

**‚ôªÔ∏è ELI5:** Like learning to ride a bike: try (Act) ‚Üí see what happened (Assess) ‚Üí adjust your balance (Adapt) ‚Üí try again. You don't plan all your balance adjustments in advance - you figure them out as you go.
</details>

## Implications for Implementation

What these metaphors mean for our code:

**Single Entry Point**: ExecuteTask() handles everything - just like the returner catches every kickoff the same way, or the artist approaches every painting with the same process.

**Recursive Structure**: Parent tasks orchestrate, leaf tasks execute. Like painting: large areas decompose into smaller strokes, each following the same Act‚ÜíAssess‚ÜíAdapt cycle.

**Planning Granularity**: Maintain concrete plans for near-term actions (next 2-3 steps) while keeping distant plans as rough outlines that get refined as execution progresses.

**Sub-goal Tracking**: Monitor intermediate objectives (first downs, completed sections) that contribute to the ultimate end-goal, allowing for success evaluation at multiple levels.

**Risk/Reward Evaluation**: Each re-planning decision weighs potential benefits against costs and risks, informing whether to continue, pivot, or complete current approach.

**Plan Evolution**: Task specifications are living documents that improve through execution, like how the painting's vision evolves as the artist works.

**Failure is Information**: The returner learns from being tackled. The painter learns from color that doesn't work. Our framework learns from every error.

**Observers Don't Judge**: They report what they see, like scouts reporting defender positions. The Navigator (coach/artist) makes decisions.

**Local Adaptation**: Each level handles its own challenges. The returner adjusts their path; they don't stop to redesign the play.

## Summary: The Philosophy

The Task Execution Framework embodies a philosophy of **continuous adaptation through progressive discovery**. Rather than trying to plan perfectly upfront, we:

1. Start with a rough plan (the kickoff play design / the initial sketch)
2. Execute atomically (one step / one brushstroke)
3. Learn from what happens (field position / how the painting looks)
4. Re-plan the entire remainder (new path / next areas to paint)
5. Repeat until complete

This is not a fallback strategy for when things go wrong. This IS the strategy. Every execution teaches us something that makes the next execution better.

<details>
<summary>üéØ <strong>The Bottom Line</strong></summary>

Perfect planning is impossible because you don't know what you don't know. But perfect adaptation is achievable because each action teaches you something. Our framework maximizes robustness not through better planning, but through better adaptation.

**üéØ ELI5:** You can't know exactly how to build something until you start building it. But if you pay attention and adjust as you go, you'll end up building something great. That's what this framework does - it pays attention and adjusts continuously.
</details>

## Next Steps

With these metaphors as our guide, we can:
1. Design the concrete `ExecuteTask` implementation
2. Define the Navigator's strategist architecture  
3. Specify the Observer interfaces
4. Build the continuous re-planning mechanics

The metaphors aren't just explanatory tools - they're design patterns that inform every architectural decision.
