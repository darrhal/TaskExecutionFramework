# Test Adaptation Cycle Task

## Task Information
- **ID**: test_adaptation_001
- **Priority**: high
- **Type**: test

## Description
This is a test task designed to trigger the adaptation cycle and test navigator decision-making. The task intentionally has some ambiguity to test refinement and decomposition capabilities.

## Objective
Create a simple utility that processes data files, but with deliberately vague requirements to test the navigator's ability to refine specifications and decompose complex tasks.

## Initial Requirements
- Process some kind of data files
- Do something useful with the data
- Handle errors appropriately
- Provide some kind of output

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Files are processed successfully
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Output is generated
- [ ] Code is well-structured

## Notes
This task is intentionally underspecified to test:
1. Navigator's refinement decisions when requirements are unclear
2. Decomposition when task complexity is detected
3. Progressive elaboration adding detail as task approaches execution
4. Multi-strategist perspective gathering
5. Plan modification based on assessment results
