# Hello World Test Task

This is a simple test task designed to validate the Phase 1 minimal orchestrator functionality.

## Purpose

This task serves as the basic smoke test for the Task Execution Framework prototype. It should:

1. **Load successfully** into the task queue
2. **Execute** through the Act phase (simulated in Phase 1)
3. **Assess** the execution results (simulated in Phase 1)  
4. **Adapt** the plan based on assessment (simulated in Phase 1)
5. **Complete** and mark itself as done

## Expected Behavior

When processed by the orchestrator, this task should:

- Generate a unique task ID
- Create state files for tracking progress
- Execute through all three phases of the loop
- Log execution artifacts
- Mark itself as completed

## Success Criteria

The task is successful if:
- [x] Task appears in task_queue.json
- [x] execution_history.json contains execution record
- [x] observations.json contains assessment results
- [x] plan_updates.json contains adaptation decisions
- [x] Task status changes to "completed"

This task validates that the basic Act->Assess->Adapt loop is functional and ready for Phase 2 enhancements.
