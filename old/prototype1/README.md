# Task Execution Framework - Natural Language Prototype

## Quick Start

This directory contains a natural language programming prototype of the Task Execution Framework (TEF). The prototype demonstrates how complex, self-directing workflows can be implemented using Claude Code's Task tool and minimal traditional programming.

## Directory Contents

### Documentation
- **[APPROACH_SUMMARY.md](APPROACH_SUMMARY.md)** - High-level overview of the natural language programming approach and philosophy
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** - Detailed, hierarchical task breakdown for building the prototype

### Implementation (To Be Created)
- **`tef_orchestrator.py`** - Minimal Python orchestrator (~200 lines)
- **`agents/`** - Natural language agent instruction templates
- **`state/`** - JSON files for inter-agent communication
- **`tasks/`** - Task specifications in markdown
- **`runs/`** - Execution artifacts and logs
- **`examples/`** - Sample tasks and workflows

## What Is This?

This prototype explores a radical approach to the Task Execution Framework: instead of writing traditional code, we use natural language instructions to create self-directing agents that collaborate through shared state files.

### Key Concepts

1. **Natural Language Programming**: Agent behavior defined through markdown instructions rather than code
2. **State-Based Communication**: Agents share context through persistent JSON files
3. **Self-Directing Execution**: The system continues running until tasks are complete
4. **Act→Assess→Adapt Loop**: Core control pattern implemented through agent orchestration

## How to Use This Directory

### For Understanding the Concept
1. Read **APPROACH_SUMMARY.md** for the high-level vision
2. Review the philosophy and architecture sections
3. Understand how natural language replaces traditional programming

### For Implementation
1. Start with **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**
2. Follow the phased approach (Phase 0 → Phase 8)
3. Check off tasks as you complete them
4. Use the "Quick Win Path" for a minimal viable prototype

### For Experimentation
Once implemented:
1. Create task specifications in `tasks/`
2. Run the orchestrator: `python tef_orchestrator.py --task tasks/your_task.md`
3. Monitor agent execution in `runs/`
4. Observe state evolution in `state/`

## Implementation Status

- [x] Conceptual design complete
- [x] Detailed implementation plan created
- [ ] Phase 0: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Phase 1: Minimal Orchestrator
- [ ] Phase 2: Executor Agent
- [ ] Phase 3: Observer System
- [ ] Phase 4: Navigator Implementation
- [ ] Phase 5: Full Loop Integration
- [ ] Phase 6: Natural Language Features
- [ ] Phase 7: Production Readiness
- [ ] Phase 8: Advanced Features

## Key Benefits

- **Minimal Code**: ~200 lines of Python vs thousands for traditional implementation
- **Self-Documenting**: Instructions are human-readable documentation
- **Easy Modification**: Change behavior by editing markdown, not code
- **Observable**: Watch agents "think" through their tasks
- **Resumable**: Stop and restart execution at any point

## Next Steps

1. **Quick Prototype** (5 hours): Implement Phases 0-1 and basic executor for proof of concept
2. **Full Prototype** (3-4 days): Complete Phases 0-5 for working system
3. **Production Ready** (1-2 weeks): All phases including documentation and testing

## Philosophy

> "Replace functions with conversations, and code with instructions."

This prototype demonstrates that complex systems can emerge from simple natural language instructions when properly orchestrated. It's not just a different way to code - it's a fundamentally different approach to creating intelligent systems.

## Contributing

This prototype is designed to be accessible to both developers and domain experts. Contributions can be:
- **Agent Instructions**: Improve or add new agent templates
- **Task Examples**: Create interesting demonstration tasks
- **Documentation**: Enhance understanding and usability
- **Code**: Improve the minimal orchestrator

Remember: The goal is to minimize traditional code and maximize natural language instructions.
